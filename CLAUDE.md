# Modern Classics

Modernize classic public domain texts into engaging, accessible contemporary English
using Claude as both the orchestrator and the translator.

## Project Goal

Take old public domain books with archaic language and retell them in a modern,
conversational voice — faithful to the original meaning but genuinely fun to read.
Target reading level: eighth grade to high school.

## How a Translation Works

Each book goes through these phases:

### 1. Setup — Prepare the source text

- Obtain a plain text version of the book (standardebooks.org is the best source,
  Project Gutenberg is the secondary source)
- Place the source text in a new directory: `{book}/`
- Create a `{book}/env` file with metadata:
  ```
  ORIGINAL_WORK=Title of the Work
  AUTHOR=Author Name
  DATE=Year
  SUBTITLE=optional subtitle shown under the title
  SOURCE_NAME=Project Gutenberg          # optional attribution link
  SOURCE_URL=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/NNNN
  MODERN_YEAR=2026
  ```
- Split the source into chapter files with `splitter.py`:
  ```
  python3 splitter.py {book}/source.txt --headings '^CHAPTER [IVXL]+\..*$'
  ```
  It strips the Gutenberg wrapper, auto-splits chapters over ~7k words into
  parts at paragraph boundaries (a translation agent must *output* as much
  text as it reads, so output limits — not input context — are the binding
  constraint), writes `chapters/NNN.txt`, and emits `manifest.json`, which is
  the single source of truth for file → chapter mapping from here on.
  Text before the first heading lands in `preamble.txt` — decide explicitly
  whether to fold it into chapter 000 (dedications belong in the book) or
  drop it (tables of contents do not).
- Hand-edit `manifest.json` to add `"part_before"` dividers (e.g.
  `"Part II: Of Commonwealth"`) and, for a front-matter file holding several
  sections, `"split_headings"`.

### 2. Text Analysis — Develop a translation strategy

Before translating any chapters, analyze the full work and write
`{book}/text_analysis.txt` covering:

- Style, tone, and key themes of the original
- Challenges specific to this text (archaic vocabulary, cultural references, etc.)
- Consistent vocabulary mappings (archaic → modern equivalents)
- How to preserve the author's distinctive voice in modern English
- **Famous passages** that must survive near-verbatim — also list these in
  `{book}/must_contain.txt` so `verify.py` checks them mechanically
- Any content that needs careful handling, with explicit guidance

**Sensitive historical content:** canonical works discuss war, rebellion,
punishment, and religious conflict. Frame every subagent prompt as scholarly
modernization of a canonical historical text, and put the handling guidance
(measured register, render the author's argument as *his* argument, never
sensationalize or bowdlerize) in the analysis doc. This framing is what got
Leviathan through cleanly after an earlier attempt tripped safety filters.

### 3. Chapter-by-chapter Translation — shared-ledger pattern

Don't translate strictly sequentially with chapter-to-chapter notes passing;
use the shared-ledger pattern (proven on Leviathan, ~5x faster with no
consistency loss):

- Write `{book}/agent_instructions.txt` once: the standing prompt every
  translation subagent reads (persona, required reading, translation rules,
  heading conventions, multi-part file rules, output format). Subagent
  prompts then shrink to a few lines: file number, chapter title, anything
  chapter-specific.
- Maintain `{book}/running_notes.txt`: the accumulated consistency ledger —
  locked vocabulary ("caps spent, no re-gloss"), tone calibration, forward
  references to honor. Every agent reads it; the orchestrator (not the
  agents) updates it between batches from the agents' returned notes.
- Translate the first file **alone** to establish the voice, then run
  parallel batches of 4–6 subagents, updating the ledger between batches.
- Each agent writes `modern_chapters/NNN.txt` and returns (a) a short
  summary and (b) consistency notes for the ledger.
- **Specify exact heading strings in the prompts** ("Chapter 42: Of
  Ecclesiastical Power") rather than letting parallel agents invent them —
  independent reasonable choices are where seam bugs come from.
- Multi-part chapters: heading line, then `(Part n of k)`, then the
  translation; parts 2+ never re-introduce the chapter, non-final parts
  never conclude it.

### 4. Verify — before assembly

```
python3 verify.py {book}
```

Checks every chapter has a modern counterpart, per-file word ratios are
within 0.6–1.6 (catches silent summarization — the project's worst failure
mode), part markers haven't leaked into the body, no part divider appears
twice (the classic seam bug between parallel agents), and every phrase in
`must_contain.txt` survived. Fix failures before assembling.

### 5. Assembly — Combine into a readable book

```
python3 assemble.py {book}        # writes site/{book}.html
```

Generic and data-driven: page shell from `site/template.html`, metadata from
`{book}/env`, structure from `manifest.json` (multi-part chapters are
stitched back into single chapters; `part_before` entries become part
dividers in the TOC and body). Subheadings, indented outlines, and paragraph
rendering are handled by convention — see the docstring.

Then add the book to `site/index.html`.

## Translation Philosophy

The translator persona is: an expert scholar who has studied this work their
entire life, who is also a gifted storyteller, retelling the story for a modern
audience.

Key principles:
- **Faithful but not literal** — preserve meaning, tone, and narrative arc
- **Conversational and engaging** — modern turns of phrase, natural rhythm
- **Complete** — translate the entire text, don't summarize or truncate
- **Consistent** — maintain vocabulary choices and voice across chapters
- **Respectful** — handle dated cultural content thoughtfully

What to modernize:
- Archaic vocabulary → modern equivalents
- Complex/nested sentence structures → clearer modern syntax
- Outdated references → brief contextual explanations where needed
- Punctuation and formatting → modern conventions

What to preserve:
- The author's distinctive voice and style
- Famous passages and quotations
- Narrative structure and pacing
- Literary devices and imagery

## Directory Structure

```
{book}/                    # One directory per book
  env                      # Metadata (see Setup above)
  {source}.txt             # Original full text
  chapters/                # Split chapter files (000.txt, 001.txt, ...)
  manifest.json            # File -> chapter map; drives translation + assembly
  text_analysis.txt        # Translation strategy document
  agent_instructions.txt   # Standing prompt for translation subagents
  running_notes.txt        # Shared consistency ledger, updated between batches
  must_contain.txt         # Famous passages verify.py checks for
  modern_chapters/         # Translated chapters (000.txt, 001.txt, ...)
```

## Tooling

- `splitter.py` — source text → `chapters/` + `manifest.json` (heading-regex
  or legacy splits-file mode; Gutenberg stripping; oversize auto-split)
- `verify.py` — mechanical completeness/consistency checks before assembly
- `assemble.py` — `modern_chapters/` + `manifest.json` + `env` +
  `site/template.html` → `site/{book}.html`
- `legacy/` — the original API-based batch translator and prompt templates,
  plus old book-specific assemblers. Reference only; see `legacy/README.md`
  (note: their `max_tokens` settings truncate full chapters).

Claude Code does the translation work directly — reading chapters,
orchestrating translation subagents, and writing the output files. The API
scripts are not part of the current workflow.

and Franklin's Autobiography (see autobiography/prep.py for the
Standard-Ebooks-XHTML source pattern).

Current push (July 2026): the "Founders' Library" — the founding
